# Assignment 10  
## AutoMPG Data Processing & Statistical Pipeline

---

## Overview

This project contains two primary components:

1. **AutoMPG Data Processing System**  
   An object-oriented application that loads, cleans, sorts, logs, and saves automobile MPG data using a structured command-line interface.

2. **Statistical Pipeline Tool (`compute_stats.py`)**  
   A Unix-style command-line utility that reads numeric data from standard input and computes descriptive statistics using NumPy.

This assignment demonstrates:

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- File I/O and data cleaning
- Custom logging configuration
- Command-line interface (CLI) design with `argparse`
- Python integration with Unix shell pipelines
- NumPy-based statistical computation
